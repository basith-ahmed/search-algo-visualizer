## Demo

## Algorithms

### 1. A* Algorithm
A popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm known for its performance and accuracy. It uses heuristics to efficiently navigate through the grid.

### 2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It explores all possible paths to determine the shortest one.

### 3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level neighbors. Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### 4. Depth-First Search (DFS)
Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Useful for scenarios where all possible paths need to be explored.

### 5. Greedy Best-First Search
Selects the path that appears to lead most directly to the goal, using a heuristic to prioritize nodes.

### 6. Bidirectional Search
Simultaneously searches forward from the start node and backward from the end node, meeting in the middle to find the shortest path.
